  "introduction": "Hi, my name is Ben. I am a Junior in the IT: Software Development program here at UC. I am from Huber Heights, OH. I found my passion for programming during my Junior year of high school where I got to take part in a robotics project and learned how to program in Basic Stamp to make this robot do what I wanted it to. I originally came to UC to study Computer Engineering, but I found myself switching to IT after my first semester. I have been a member of the UC Bearcat Marching Band for two years now where I play trombone. I've really gotten to experience the campus life through marching band and it was one of the best decisions I ever made. I am looking forward to applying my skills and learning new things to make myself a better programmer and developer.",
